# hello-world
My first repo

I'm using Github to learn about how to commit changes to master branch.
I'll be building beautifully animated mobile apps in Flutter. I come from a designers' background, so I'll be learning things through that frame of reference on the front-end side (using tools like Sketch and design-to-code Supernova).
Back-end side, I'm sticking with Python because I've used it before in my Public Policy studies, and it's prettty well-equipped with libraries to tackle some of the NLP stuff I'm looking to work on.
